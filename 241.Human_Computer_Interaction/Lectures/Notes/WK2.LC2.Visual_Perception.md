## Gestalt Principles: Perceiving Form
Gestalt is a German word meaning "unified whole". These principles describe how our brains simplify complex images by perceiving structure, patterns, and whole objects. The core idea is that the human brain will choose the simplest possible interpretation of a visual image. In design, these principles are used to guide the layout of interfaces and information to effectively communicate structure.

### Key Principles
- Emergence: We perceive a whole object or "big picture" at once, without needing to consciously analyse the individual parts. A classic example is seeing a Dalmatian from a pattern of black spots.
- Closure: Our minds automatically fill in the gaps in an image to see a complete, familiar shape, even when parts are missing.
- Continuity: We perceive elements as a group when they follow the same path or direction. We see a continuous shape even if it's partly blocked.
- Proximity: Objects that are close to each other are perceived as belonging to a single group.
- Similarity: We group objects that share visual characteristics like colour, shape, or size.
- Common Region (Enclosure): Elements located within the same boundary or region are perceived as a single group.
- Figure/Ground: The brain separates a visual scene into a foreground (figure) and a background (ground). The figure receives more attention. This effect is enhanced by using contrast, where smaller, brighter, or crisper objects appear to be in front.

## Visual Search & Preattentive Processing
How information is structured visually has a major impact on how quickly we can find what we're looking for.
### Visual Search
Good visual structure, created through effective spacing, grouping, and alignment, helps us scan and understand information much faster. In one experiment, improving the visual structure of a screen reduced the average search time from 5.5 seconds to 3.2 seconds.
### Preattentive Processing
This is the very rapid processing of visual information that happens automatically and effortlessly across our entire visual field.

- It occurs in under 200-250ms, which is faster than the time it takes to move our eyes.
- It relies on our peripheral vision.
- In design, we use it to draw attention to critical information "at a glance".
### Pop-Out Features
These are specific visual properties that our brains can spot preattentively, without needing focused attention.

- Examples: Colour and shape are strong pop-out features.
- Strength: Some features are more effective than others. Colour is a stronger pop-out feature than shape.
- Combined Features: Searching for a combination of features (e.g., a blue square among blue circles and red squares) is slower and requires more conscious effort.
- Communicating Data: Some pop-out features can convey quantitative information efficiently, such as length, size, position, and orientation.

## Visual Encoding of Data

Visualisation uses perceptual channels to represent different types of data. The effectiveness of a visualisation depends on choosing the right channel for the right data type.

### Data Types
- Categorical (Nominal): Data with named attributes but no intrinsic order (e.g., 'apples', 'oranges', 'bananas').
- Ordinal: Data where the values have a logical order but the magnitude between them isn't defined (e.g., 'small', 'medium', 'large').
- Quantitative: Data that has a numerical magnitude (e.g., 10, 25, 50).
### Effectiveness of Visual Channels
Different visual properties are better suited for different data types.

| **Perceptual Channel**       | **Best For...**          | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Position**                 | Quantitative 33          | A highly expressive and accurate channel for showing magnitude34.                                                                                                                                |
| **Length / Size**            | Quantitative 35          | Very effective for making "at a glance" comparisons of magnitude36.                                                                                                                              |
| **Colour Value (Lightness)** | Ordinal 37               | Perceived as ordered (e.g., from light to dark)3838. Less effective for quantitative data because we are better at seeing contrast than absolute values3939.                                     |
| **Colour Hue**               | Categorical (Nominal) 40 | Perceived as unordered, making it ideal for distinguishing between different categories4141. **Rainbow scales are generally not recommended** as they don't have a clear perceptual order424242. |
| **Shape**                    | Categorical (Nominal) 43 | Good for distinguishing categories, but less effective than position or length for quantitative data44.                                                                                          |
