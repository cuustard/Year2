## Physiology of the Eye

|Structure|Function|
|---|---|
|**Iris**|Controls light entering the eye (pupil size).|
|**Lens**|Focuses light onto retina (adjusts for near/far objects).|
|**Retina**|Contains **photoreceptors** (rods & cones) that detect light.|
|**Fovea**|Central area of retina with highest cone density → sharp vision.|
|**Optic nerve**|Sends visual signals to the brain.|
The **fovea** provides high detail and colour perception; the **periphery** detects motion and brightness.

## Retina: Photoreceptors

|Type|Function|Location|Sensitivity|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Rods**|Detect light intensity (brightness)|Peripheral retina|Very light-sensitive; no colour|
|**Cones**|Detect colour and fine detail|Central retina (fovea)|Less light-sensitive; three types (L, M, S)|

## Colour Sensitivity
### Cone Types and Sensitivity

|Cone Type|Peak Sensitivity|Perceived Colour|
|---|---|---|
|**S (Short)**|~420 nm|Blue|
|**M (Medium)**|~534 nm|Green|
|**L (Long)**|~564 nm|Red|
- L and M cones outnumber S cones **10:1** → better red/green than blue perception.
- Cones convert light energy into neural (biological) signals.

## Receptor Signal Processing
The brain combines cone signals into **three opponent channels**:

|Channel|Combination|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Lightness**|L + M + S|Overall brightness|
|**Red–Green**|L – M|Colour contrast|
|**Yellow–Blue**|(L + M) – S|Colour contrast|
Explains why **red–green** and **blue–yellow** are perceived as opposite colours.

## Colour Vision Anomalies (Colour Blindness)

|Type|Missing Cones|Deficiency|Prevalence|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Protanopia**|L (red)|Red deficiency|–|
|**Deuteranopia**|M (green)|Green deficiency|–|
|**Tritanopia**|S (blue)|Blue deficiency|Rare|
- Red/green deficiencies affect ~**8% of men**.

## Foveal and Peripheral Vision

|Feature|Foveal|Peripheral|
|---|---|---|
|**Field size**|~1–2° (thumbnail at arm’s length)|Up to 200° horizontally|
|**Resolution**|High (fine detail)|Low|
|**Colour sensitivity**|High|Low|
|**Function**|Reading, recognition|Motion & stimulus detection|

## Eye Movements
### Fixations
- Eye aligns fovea on a point of interest.
- Duration: **≥200 ms** to extract information.
### Saccades
- Rapid jumps between fixations.
- Duration: **20–30 ms**.
- Rate: up to **3–4 cycles/sec**.
![[Pasted image 20251019130320.png]]
### Viewing Range
- Comfortable range:
    - ~20° left/right,
    - ~30° downward.
- Larger shifts use **head movement**.
- Important for ergonomic screen setup (≤40° total visual field).

### Eye–Head Coordination
- Large gaze shifts = combined **eye + head** movement.
- Maintains comfort and coverage.

## Binocular Vision

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Cyclopean model**|Fuses both eyes’ input into one visual “canvas”.|
|**Binocular model**|Two separate cameras (eyes) offset by IPD (inter-pupillary distance).|
![[Pasted image 20251019130401.png]]
### Binocular Disparity
- Each eye views from a slightly different angle → **parallax**.
- Disparity provides **depth cues** → used in **stereoscopic displays** (VR).

### Vergence–Accommodation Reflex

|Mechanism|Description|
|---|---|
|**Vergence**|Eyes rotate inward to fixate on an object.|
|**Accommodation**|Lens changes shape for focus.|
In VR, **fixed focal planes** can cause vergence–accommodation conflicts → discomfort.

---
## Visual–Vestibular Interaction
- **Vestibular system** senses head motion and balance.
- **Optical flow**: motion patterns across the retina.
- Combined info = perception of **self-motion**.
- Conflict between visual and vestibular cues → **motion/simulator sickness** (common in VR).

## Key Points on Human Vision
- The **eye** integrates optical elements (iris, lens) with sensors (rods & cones).
- **Foveal vision** = high acuity, colour detail.
- **Peripheral vision** = wide coverage, motion detection.
- Vision relies on **saccades** and **eye-head coordination** for full coverage.
- **Binocular integration** provides depth.
- Awareness of **conflicts & anomalies** is key in visual design (e.g., VR, accessibility).
---
## Colour Perception
- Colour is **not a property of light or objects** — it’s a **perceptual construct**.
- Objects appear coloured based on **which wavelengths they reflect**.
- “Colour is in the eye and brain of the beholder.”
- **Colour models** help describe and manipulate colours accurately.

## Colour Models

|Model|Type|Used for|Key Components|
|---|---|---|---|
|**RGB**|Additive|Screens|(R, G, B) = (0–255) → combine to make white|
|**CMYK**|Subtractive|Print media|Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black)|
|**HSV**|Perceptual|Design & HCI|**Hue:** position on spectrum  <br>**Saturation:** purity  <br>**Value:** brightness|
Centre of RGB cube = **grey/neutral colour** (equal R, G, B values).

---
## Colour Perception & Contrast
- Perception depends on **contrast** and **adjacent colours** (see _Bezold Effect_)
- Human vision = excellent at detecting **contrast**, poor at detecting **absolute brightness**.
- Use contrast effectively for clarity, readability, and accessibility.
---
## Key Points on Colour
- Colour emerges from **differential receptor responses** (L, M, S cones).
- Human colour naming is limited → use **models** (RGB, CMYK, HSV).
- **Contrast** is more perceptually important than absolute colour levels.
- Always **design for colour-blind accessibility**.
