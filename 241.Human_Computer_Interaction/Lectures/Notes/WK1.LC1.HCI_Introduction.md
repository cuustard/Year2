## Module Overview

Learning outcomes:
- Recognise the significance of HCI for the development of systems that users can successfully, efficiently, and safely use.
- Employ knowledge of human abilities and behaviour to analyse user interface problems and motivate user interface designs.
- Apply HCI principles and guidelines in the design and implementation of interactive systems.
- Evaluate the usability and user experience of interactive systems using appropriate methods and metrics.

## What HCI Is, Interactive Systems, And User Interface

> "Human-computer interaction is a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them‚Äù (definition in the ACM SIGCHI Curricula for HCI, 1992)


Computer systems are interactive and have people involved.

An **Interactive System** is a computational system that allows user to interact in real-time. 'Real time' means that interactions receive instant (or a response that is perceive as instant usually in the order of 100ms) feedback visible to the user. 

> "combination of hardware and/or software and/or services and/or people that users interact with to achieve specific goals."


The **User Interface** is the part of a system through which a user can interact, composed of software and/or hardware that supports input, output, or both. This is not restricted to digital and interactive systems. 

> "all components of an interactive system (software or hardware) that provide information and controls for the user to complete specific tasks with the interactive system"

## Why HCI is Important

The design of the user interface and of the interaction determines how we use products and services. It is the part of a system users experience. It determines our performance and how we feel about the system.

| Quality         | Definition                                              | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Utility         | What a system enables the user to do.                   | The tasks a user can complete in interaction with a system.<br>For a given goal, utility is an essential quality.                                      |
| Usability       | How well a user can use a system to achieve their goals | How difficult the system is to learn and use. How efficient and effective is the UI. How safe the operation of the system is.                          |
| User Experience | The experience of using a system                        | It's behaviour and how it feels.<br>Utility and usability are fundamental for a good user experience.<br>Also depends on social and emotional factors. |

### HCI Economic Relevance

Easy-to-use products are good for business. Good usability is often considered a sign of quality. It provides a competitive advantage. Improving the UX can:
- Increase user productivity (completing tasks more efficiently)
- Reduce costs (less training and support needed)
- Increase sales/revenue (online shopping)
- Enhance customer loyalty (dissatisfied user will not come back)

### Usability as a Discriminating Factor

Users discriminate products by functionality and price. There are thousands of products that offer similar functionality at a similar price so the UI becomes the discriminating factor. Alternative products are just a few clicks away and comparison are easily possible so if the users have a poor experience, they can easily move on.
