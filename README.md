## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repository is used to:

- Consolidate and organize **personal study notes**
- Collaboratively create a **comprehensive reference** for all Year 2 modules
- Maintain **consistent, version-controlled updates** using GitHub

Although the repo is public, it is primarily intended for private collaborative use.

## ðŸ§© Collaboration Workflow

- Both collaborators work directly within the vault.
- Changes are committed using standard **Git commits**.
- No branching workflow is currently in use
- Each contributor should **pull before editing** and **commit + push** when finished to minimize conflicts.

## ðŸª„ Integrations

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for visual notes and diagrams
- [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) for AI-generated audio summaries or overviews

---
## ðŸ“˜ Notes

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files are optimized for viewing in **Obsidian**.
- Internal links, Excalidraw files, and plugin-based features may not render properly on GitHubâ€™s web interface.
- All included PDFs and diagrams are self-contained within the repository.
