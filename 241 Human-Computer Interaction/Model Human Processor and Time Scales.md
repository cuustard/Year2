In cognitive science, humans are perceived as information processors. Through **perception** we gain information from sensors. Through **cognition** we process information based on existing knowledge, gain new knowledge, and make a decision. Finally, through **motor action** we output information into the world by speaking, gesturing, writing, drawing, manipulating objects, and navigating through the world.

In computer science, we have models that describe the performance of computers at a systems level like, the types of processors and their clock speeds, types of memory and their capacity, and how everything is connected. This enables a rough prediction of how long it takes to process information. 

The **Model Human Processor** (MHP) allows us to do the same for humans. It describes human performance as it relates to [[Human-Computer Interaction]]. The takes the eyes are ears as input, arm-hand-finger as output, and the brain for processors and memories. In this model there are 3 interacting subsystems:
- Perceptual system
- Motor system
- Cognitive system

Processors and Memories:

The Perceptual System is composed of perceptual memory and processor and is responsible for converting external events into a form that the cognitive system can process.

The **Motor System** translates thought into action. The cycle time:
- T<sub>M</sub> = 70ms, time required to issue a motor command. Between 30-100ms depending on task.
