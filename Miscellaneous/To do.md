- [ ] Make folder for pasted images to be stored in. And figure out how to get them to go in there instead of the root.

I don't think we need individual folders for diagrams (pasted images etc) for each lecture and workshop folder per module. We're never going to be looking at them by themselves on their own tab, only embedded in a note. So essentially, they don't need to be organised. I think there should just be a folder in the root directory called 'diagrams' that we just store every pasted image in.
