## Data Engineering

Data is information represented in binary. Data is constantly being collected, and created. Whenever we do anything. We collect data to retrieve information. To do this we must process data.

> "Data engineering is the process of designing and building systems that allow people to collect, manage, and analyse, data. They work to make raw data useable for data scientists and business analysts for organisations to use it to improve their performance."

Data engineers are responsible for data pipelines, data integrity, data quality, data analysis, data security, and automation. They create data pipelines to manage and process large sets of data. They ensure that data from multiple sources is integrated seamlessly. They ensure that data is oh high quality and that the data infrastructure is reliable and efficient. They create raw data analyses to provide predictive models and show trends. They manage and store data securely to protect it from loss or theft. They create ways to automate tasks within the data pipeline to improve efficiency.

## Databases

Databases are structured systems for storing, retrieving, and managing data. Relational > Flatfile. Raw data is stored in databases before being processes. It is organised using data models which define how data is related and how it is stored. Tot keep things efficient, efficient query execution and fast access to large datasets are crucial for databases. Secure storage and access control of sensitive data is handled within databases.

A Database represents a massive amount of persistent data according to a logical model. This model can be represented graphically by UML or Entity Relationship Diagrams.

A Database Management System provides efficient, reliable, convenient, safe, multi-user friendly storage access to massive amounts of persistent data.

To represent the logic of the database, designing a database requires documentation that will be used to reveal database requirements and perform debugging/update, and maintenance with ease. 

Data Definition Language is used to create tables. Data Manipulation Language is used to modify tables and data.

An Entity is an object that has distinguishable attributes. An Entity set is a conceptual representation of entities w.r.t the same set of attributes is called an Entity Set. Rectangles are used to represent an entity set. Oval is used to represent an attribute. NEVER used arrows.

Redundancy when two identical entities.
