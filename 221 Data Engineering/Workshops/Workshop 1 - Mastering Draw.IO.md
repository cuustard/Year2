## Mastering Draw.IO

1. Proceed to https://app.diagrams.net/
2. Select one of your preferred storage option. I selected “Device”.
3. Select “Create New Image”.
4. Choose the “Entity Relation Diagram” option.
	1. Please note, in the Entity Relation Diagram option there are different kinds of ERD diagrams available, you have to use the ones we saw in the lectures!
5. Spend 10 minutes to understand the application if this is the first time you have used it.
6. After that, draw the following ERDs.
	1. There is a table with three attributes, a,b and c. b is the primary key.
	2. There is a table with six attributes a,b,c,d,e, and f. a and b are primary key.(10 mins.)
	3. Follow these links
		1. https://github.com/jhideki/palworldapi/blob/master/data/pals_basic.csv
		2. https://github.com/jhideki/palworldapi/blob/master/data/pal_stats.csv
	4. Investigate the files and create the ERD that corresponds to these csv files (please note these CSV files represent database tables.)
