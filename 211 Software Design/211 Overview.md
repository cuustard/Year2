## Lectures

Being 'Done?' means that notes for that lecture are completed, text, tables, images, diagrams, and all. Lectures should not be copied 1:1, they should be abstracted to discard unnecessary details, and rewritten for our understanding.

## Workshops

For workshops, being 'Done?' means that as well as any notes needed to be taken, the tasks for that workshop are also completed. Also 211 workshops started week 2 hence the first workshop being week 2 content.
