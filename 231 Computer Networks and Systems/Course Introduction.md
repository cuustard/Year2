The module aims to instil a deep understanding of how computer operating systems and network interact to enable the distributed applications that are ubiquitous in the world today and to convey the knowledge and practical experience of internet architecture, network protocols, and operating system principles expected of all computer science graduates.

Term 1 covers:
- System Design
- Operating Systems
- Internet Protocol Stack
- Application Layer
- Transport layer
- Network layer
- Link Layer

Python focus for this module this year. 70% Exam. Exams in summer term. Any topic in lecture or labs could be in final exam, unless stated otherwise. 30% Coursework. Network application development split into multiple parts about 1 part per week totals 30% 

A system is a collection of components (like hardware or software) that work together to achieve a goal. What makes this collection a system, is the interactions between each component with one another - not just the collection of components itself. Systems engineering involves designing, integrating, and managing complex systems throughout their entire life-cycle.

We'll explore three standard computing systems:

1. Operating Systems
2. Networks/The Internet
3. Cloud Infrastructures

## Operating Systems
#operatingSystems 

Have hardware components/resources like the CPU, memory, and devices. Systems communicate via IPC channels (pipes, message queues, shared memory, signals). The goal is to share resources (e.g. CPU, Memory, disk, devices) across multiple processes

Operating System is like a layer of software that sits between CPU and hardware resources. It gives us an interface. 

An OS (Operating System) is a software layer that sits between hardware and user applications. It manages resources, allows safe and convenient programming abstractions, and provides services like scheduling and device drivers.

The building blocks of OS's are Virtualisation, Concurrency, Persistence, and Security.

## The Network / Internet
#theNetwork

Has physical connections like links and interfaces. There is communication across machines via sockets & protocols). There is end-to-end data transfer via logical channels between processes. 

The internet has 3 main components: Hosts, Communication Links, Packet Switches. The hosts are the billions of connected computing devices running network apps at the internets edge. The Packet Switches forward packets of data via routers and switches. Communication links like fiber, copper, radio, and satellite. Bandwidth is the transmission rate. 

The internet is an infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications like the web, e-mail, games, etc. The Internet is a network of networks. Protocols send and receive messages and protocol standards ensure standard delivery of data. A protocol defines the format, order of data exchanged among network entities, and actions, to be taken on message transmission/receipt/non-receipt.

## The Cloud
#cloud

Entire server clusters and virtual machines and containers
